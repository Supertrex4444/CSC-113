## Comparative Analysis
After testing four prompts on Gemini, Claude, and Chat GPT, I was able to determine some key differences between the AI tools. 
Gemini is built towards giving the fastest answers to my prompts. Claude provided the most detailed and professional responses. 
ChatGPT was more conversational than the other two models.

There seems to be a time and a place for each AI tool. If I needed consistent and quick answers, I would use Gemini. 
When programming software or needing very detailed information Claude would be the best option. 
If the goal of talking to an AI was for the conversation aspect itself, I would use ChatGPT.


## My Choice for Primary Tool
**Tool**: Claude
**Reasoning**: Claude works best for deep programming tasks. Although it is not as fast as Gemini, I prefer higher quality answers over getting answers quickly
**Backup Plan**: Temporarily use Gemini
