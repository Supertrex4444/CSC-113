## Reflection
The Conversation with Kevin from IT was informative and interesting. Giving the chatbot an identity made them try to act more natural.
Compared to a regular ChatGPT, Kevin was much more conversational and easier to listen to or read from. I will use this persona approach in the future whenever I can.
